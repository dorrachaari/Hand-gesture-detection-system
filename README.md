# Gestures
This is an algorithm developed using Python libraries such as OpenCV to capture video frames in addition to math and  numpy to support  large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays in order to to create a system that detects hand gestures and make commands according to them.
